# Music File Randomizer

My old reliable Powershell script kept flubbing this task, so I decided to make my own little C++ program to do it for me.
I was using the popular one found online but it would for some reason occasionally insert two random integers as the prefix.
I would rather make this one file than learn Powershell scripting right now.
This program simply adds 3 random digits to the front of all files in a given directory. 
Assumes you give it a proper directory, anything that happens due to a mistake is on the user. 

# Instructions
Compile my .cpp with the compiler of your choice then run it in a terminal. Make sure you paste/type in the path for the desired directory correctly.
This program was made with C++20 support, however it should compile and run fine on C++17. Run this in any terminal of your choice, the location of the executable you compiled doesn't matter at all as well.
